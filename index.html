      <li><em><strong><u>Waking the Fallen</u> (2003):</strong></em> Is the second studio album by Avenged Sevenfold, released on August 26, 2003, by Hopeless Records. It is the band's first full-length album with new lead guitarist Synyster Gates and 
        bassist Johnny Christ.<br><br>
        The album was released as a double 12-inch gray marble vinyl in 2008 in the US. It was certified gold on July 15, 2009, even though it only sold 3,000 copies on its first week of release. As of August 2014, the album has sold over 693,000 
        copies in the United States. As of March 17, 2021, the album has been certified Platinum. The song "Eternal Rest" appears on Kerrang!'s "666 Songs You Must Own" and was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Saw IV (2007).</li>

        </div>

      <li><em><strong><u>City of Evil</u> (2005):</strong></em> Is the third studio album by Avenged Sevenfold released on June 6, 2005 by Warner Records. Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, City of Evil contains a more traditional heavy metal and hard 
        rock sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous two albums, which showcased a predominantly metalcore sound. The album is also notable for the absence of screaming vocals. M. Shadows worked for months before the album's release with vocal coach 
        Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell, to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone". In order to increase stamina and strength on the pedals, The Rev would sit for hours practicing until he 
        could get up to 210 beats per minute. The album was ranked No. 63 on Guitar World magazine's "100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time". City of Evil also appears in Kerrang!'s "666 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" and "50 Albums You 
        Need To Hear Before You Die".</li>

      <li><em><strong><u>Avenged Sevenfold</u> (2007):</strong></em> (also known as The White Album) is the self-titled fourth studio album by Avenged Sevenfold, released on October 30, 2007. It is their last full studio album to feature drummer 
        The Rev, who died in December 2009 during the production of the follow-up album, Nightmare.<br><br>
        Originally slated for an October 16 release, it was delayed by two weeks in order to provide more time to complete bonus material and production 
        for the record. The album debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200. On May 4, 2021, it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The band supported the album with a tour, beginning a day before the 
        release of the album and ending in 2009.<br><br>
        Although critical reception to the album was mixed compared to previous releases, Avenged Sevenfold won the Kerrang! Award for Best Album in 2008. In addition, the album was included in Kerrang!'s 
        "666 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die". As of 2014, it has sold over 960,161 copies in the United States and 152,123 copies in the United Kingdom.</li>

      <li><em><strong><u>Nightmare</u> (2010):</strong></em> Is the fifth studio album by Avenged Sevenfold. It was released on July 27, 2010 through Warner Bros. Records. It was produced by Mike Elizondo, mixed in New York City by audio engineer 
        Andy Wallace, and mastered by Ted Jensen.<br><br>
        Nightmare is Avenged Sevenfold's first album recorded without Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan performing drums on all the songs due to his death in December 2009. However, he did write parts that were 
        used for the final recordings, making this the last album he would write on, The Rev's vocals are still on the album as a tribute to him. The rest of the drum tracks were handled by Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, who also played with 
        the band for all their tours through the end of 2010. They then hired drummer Arin Ilejay, who played with the band from 2011 to 2015.</li>

      <li><em><strong><u>Hail to the King</u> (2013):</strong></em> Is the sixth studio album by Avenged Sevenfold. It was released on August 27, 2013 by Warner Bros. The album was produced by Mike Elizondo. Hail to the King is the only 
        Avenged Sevenfold album to feature drummer Arin Ilejay, prior to his departure in July 2015. It is also the first Avenged Sevenfold album without musical contributions from Ilejay's late predecessor, Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan; the bonus track, 
        "St. James", was written in his memory.<br><br>
        The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 1 on the Billboard 200. This marks Avenged Sevenfold's second album to top the Billboard chart (the first being Nightmare), as well as their first to reach number 1 in the UK, 
        topping the UK Albums Chart. It also topped the Canadian, Brazilian, Finnish and Irish album charts. Also, the album spawned two number 1 singles on Billboard's Mainstream Rock, Hail to the King, and Shepherd of Fire. The former spent 11 
        weeks on the top of the chart. On April 15, 2021 the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 1,000,000 copies.</li>

      <li><em><strong><u>The Stage</u> (2016):</strong></em> Is the seventh studio album by Avenged Sevenfold. It was released on October 28, 2016, through Capitol Records, their first release through the label. It is the first Avenged Sevenfold 
        album to feature drummer Brooks Wackerman, who joined the band in late 2014 but was not revealed as previous drummer Arin Ilejay's official replacement until Ilejay's departure in 2015, because the band wanted to find a drummer that would 
        "fit in".<br><br>
        Written and recorded throughout 2016, The Stage was musically different for the band, marking a progressive metal sound. It was a surprise release, being the first mainstream heavy metal album without promotion of any kind. It is 
        Avenged Sevenfold's first concept album, with its main theme being based on artificial intelligence and self-destruction of society. It is the band's longest studio album at 73 minutes and 35 seconds, thus beating 2005's City of Evil by almost 
        a minute. In addition to being their longest album, The Stage features their longest song to date, "Exist", with a run-time of 15 minutes and 41 seconds.</li>
